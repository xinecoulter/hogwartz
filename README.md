## Takes aways

### Seeds

You can prepopulate your database by adding code to your `seeds.rb` file.
Just run `$ rake db:seed`

If you want to seed your database on heroku run
`$ heroku run rake db:seed`

### Relationships

`$ rake erd` will generate a PDF in your app directory of your models relationships.

Be sure to run `$ brew install graphviz` first.

### forms and params

Creating a form by hand will result in a params like the following:

```
params = {name: "Harry Potter", age: 12, id: 1, action: 'create', controller: 'students'}
```

And in your controller

```
Student.new(name: params[:name], age: params[:age])
```

`form_for` can render an HTML form for a specific model. This means your params will contain a hash representing that object.

```
params = {student: { name: "Harry Potter", age: 12 }, id: 1, action: 'create', controller: 'students'}
```

And in your controller

```
Student.new(params[:student])
```

You can pass the entire student hash in to create a new object in your controller

### forms with belongs_to and habtm

Check out the new student form for a select box drop down of houses.  Check out the edit student page for check boxes of all the students spells.
